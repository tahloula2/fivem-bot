Before moving on to the solutions, most users get an error due to not installing.
You won't get any of these errors if you install it properly.

How to install step-by-step page carefully prepared months ago --> https://github.com/MericcaN41/fivemsqlbot/wiki/Nas%C4%B1l-install%3F


I did not read the installation, I am getting an error.
----------------------------------------------------------

'node' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.

You have not installed Node.js, which is the first step of the installation.

Download link --> https://nodejs.org/dist/v14.15.5/node-v14.15.5-x64.msi

----------------------------------------------------------

cannot find module 'discord.js'

You have not loaded the modules.

Open CMD inside the folder and type this command.
npm install

----------------------------------------------------------
zone end



How do I open CMD in the folder???

SHIFT + RIGHT CLICK on an empty area in the folder where the bot's files are located.
Then you will see a button like "Open command window here" or "Open PowerShell here", click it.
Your CMD is opened in the folder.

----------------------------------------------------------

Cannot read property '0' of undefined

You are getting this error because your MySQL table names are different from those in the bot.
If you carefully read the error you get, it usually gives the file that gave the error and its line at the end of the first line.
To fix this error, you need to have some knowledge of MySQL.

The MySQL section in connection.query() mentions the table name, for example "SELECT * FROM users" <-- users.
Log into your database and look. The name of the Users table could be something different. I recommend you change the bot instead of the table name, otherwise your scripts may fail.

Let's say the name of the 'users' table is changed to 'members'. (Total conjecture)
Then we write "SELECT * FROM members" instead of "SELECT * FROM users", then we close and open the bot and our problem is fixed :)
